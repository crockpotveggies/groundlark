# Burrowlark USB — DAQUSB-01

Burrowlark is the separate 70 × 45 mm USB-C magnetometer and enclosure-climate
sensor head. It uses the PNI 14190 RM3100 XYZ module; U3/C5 and their pressure-sensor
branches are removed. The DLVR pressure sensor is on DAQHAT-01. USB-head firmware
and physical qualification remain pending.
