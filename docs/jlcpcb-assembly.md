# JLCPCB assembled DAQHAT-01 HAT

The package targets **one fabricated PCB and one assembled HAT**, the same
physical board. The current HAT is 140 × 56 mm. The frozen procurement/placement
registry still describes the earlier 117-placement, 38-line assembly.

**Export hold:** U23/C24, the 12 V FPGA input and the TI Pi supervisor require procurement
and numbered supplier-pad review. J83/F80 changed part identity; U80, SW80,
D80/D81, R120–R124, C86–C89 and C110–C112 are new. No current stock or supplier
rotation is claimed for these selections. Dated live stock observations for the
corrected fuse, supervisor, divider and antenna parts are recorded in
[power-gnss-selection.json](../hw/assembly/groundlark-fpga-hat/power-gnss-selection.json).
The exact DLVR-F50D-E1BS-I-NI3F still has no confirmed JLCPCB match. Full assembly regression remains
blocked by this mismatch; native circuit, DRC/ERC and routing replay are checked
separately. The 40 Pi supply/supervisor additions are listed in
`hw/assembly/groundlark-fpga-hat/pi-supervisor-review.json` with catalog and
supplier-pad evidence pending. Earlier packages do not describe the enlarged board.
The Pi, Trenz module, geophone, riser, supply and mounting hardware are separate
purchases. The USB sensor heads are not included.

## Files to upload

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `DAQHAT-01-Gerbers-REVIEW.zip` | Current full-export fabrication data. |
| `BOM-review.csv` and `CPL-review.csv` together | Matching current full-export part selections and placements. |

Generate a complete package with the commands below before ordering. The older
2026-09-26 local packages predate the current copper and part selections; do not
combine their Gerbers with the revised BOM.

Use the BOM and CPL from the same fresh full export, or the same corrected
overlay. Do not mix versions or reuse previous manual rotation overrides. Gerbers contain one closed outline;
BOM quantities are per HAT. Set the supplier's PCB and assembly quantities
separately: the CSV cannot control the website's quantity selector.

Packages remain local and Git-ignored. They include checksums and validation
records; source CAD, part, side or process changes require a fresh export.
The package retains manufacturing holds and is not a fabrication approval.

## Fabrication and assembly requirements

- Six-layer FR-4, nominal 1.6 mm, TG135, ENIG, 1 oz outer / 0.5 oz inner copper.
  Use the stock JLC06161H-3313 stack, with no HDI or custom lamination.
  Its 1.5384 mm copper/dielectric sum is ordered as nominal 1.6 mm, ±10%.
- Through-vias only, 0.30/0.40 mm drills, epoxy-filled and copper-capped (POFV),
  including vias in solder pads. Tenting alone is insufficient.
  Do not fill component plated holes or non-plated mounting holes.
- Double-sided assembly. The earlier frozen registry has 107 SMT-only placements,
  seven THT-only placements and three mixed SMT/THT connectors; these counts must
  be regenerated after the export hold is resolved. J80/J81/J82 have SMT contacts and plated mounts.
  J1 is the bottom Pi socket.
- Confirm the supplier's one-piece assembly acceptance, handling frame,
  fiducials, part allocation and process requirements. Recorded Standard PCBA
  rules require a two-piece minimum and a 70 mm minimum dimension; the 140 × 56 mm
  HAT therefore needs a supplier-agreed quantity exception and handling frame.
  Do not change the requested quantity without the owner's agreement.
- Verify the supplier placement preview and final proposed production data.
  CAD, modeled tests and catalog pad fits do not establish physical fit or DFM approval.

## BOM mapping and selected parts

The [exact-part registry](../hw/assembly/groundlark-fpga-hat/daqhat-01-jlcpcb-parts.json) binds each
reference to its source value/footprint and approved manufacturer, MPN and C-code.
Catalog listing does not reserve stock or guarantee assembly eligibility.
Recheck allocation at ordering; do not accept automatic substitutes.

The earlier registry's 38 unique PCB selections (117 placements) have a dated **2026-09-27**
JLCPCB available-order observation and **minimum quantity 1**. Pre-order-only
parts and component minimums above one are prohibited. The exporter rejects
missing, insufficient or nonconforming recorded stock observations; offline
checks do not establish current stock. Recheck allocation before ordering.

| Reference | Selected replacement | Available order quantity / minimum |
| --- | --- | --- |
| U40 | ST LDL1117S33R / C435835 | 23,204 / 1 |
| D90 | TI TPD2E2U06QDCKRQ1 / C915089 | 6,229 / 1 |

The source circuit identifiers remain bound to explicit assembly overrides.
U40 retains GND/OUT/IN pins 1/2/3 and output tab. Its ceramic output capacitor
must retain at least 4.7 µF effective capacitance; C42 is 22 µF X5R, 25 V.
Allow ±3% regulator accuracy plus load/line regulation within the existing
3.18–3.42 V sensor-rail envelope. ST specifies typical 60 µVrms **per volt of
output** (198 µVrms at 3.3 V), 10 Hz–100 kHz; this is not an input-referred
geophone noise prediction. Retain the ADC analog RC filter.
D90's automotive variant preserves the SC-70 pinout, 5.5 V standoff, 10 nA
maximum leakage at 2.5 V and 1.5 pF typical capacitance.
See [ST LDL1117](https://www.st.com/resource/en/datasheet/ldl1117.pdf) and
[TI TPD2E2U06-Q1](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/tpd2e2u06-q1.pdf).

Stock is not reserved. Component MOQ 1 does not remove assembly attrition,
process charges or the separate PCB/assembly service minimum described above.
The Pi, Trenz module, external geophone and risers remain outside this PCB BOM.

| Upload field | CSV column |
| --- | --- |
| Comment / manufacturer part number | `Comment` (full orderable MPN) |
| Designator | `Designator` |
| Footprint / package | `Footprint` |
| JLCPCB / LCSC part number | `JLCPCB Part #` |

Do not use `Description` as the ordering code. Confirm all 38 nonblank catalog
identities and all 117 placements survive import.

| References | Assembly selection | Required specification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| J1 | Megastar ZX-PM2.54-2-20PY / C7499354 | Bottom-mounted 2×20 female socket, 8.5 mm body; use two external SSQ risers and measured supports. |
| C42, C80–C82 | Samsung CL31A226KAHNNNE / C12891 | 22 µF, ±10%, X5R, 25 V, 1206. |
| C84, C85 | Murata GRM21BR71C475KE51L / C408144 | 4.7 µF, ±10%, X7R, 16 V, 0805. |
| C90 | Murata GRM31C5C1H104JA01L / C97946 | 100 nF, ±5%, C0G, 50 V, 1206. |
| C91, C92 | KEMET C0603C102J5GAC7867 / C140950 | 1 nF, ±5%, C0G, 50 V, 0603. |
| F80 | Littelfuse 0466005.NRHF / C57525 | 5 A fast fuse, 32 V, 1206. |

F80 must use the 1206 assembly selection; the 0603 source-schematic MPN is not
an approved assembly part. Its nominal cold resistance is 11 mΩ, which is
included in the **30 mΩ total hot power-loop budget**, not an allowance in
addition to it. Check hot voltage drop, startup and fuse behavior on hardware.
Signal capacitors C90–C92 must retain C0G dielectric, tolerance and voltage rating.

**J1 stack:** the model uses the selected 8.5 mm socket plus two external
SSQ-120-02-G-D risers, giving 28.06 mm nominal Pi-top to HAT-underside clearance.
Four supports must match the measured seated height. The old tall Samtec socket
model and one-riser assembly are superseded. Contact engagement, retention and
GPIO signal integrity still require first-article checks; see [stack assembly](stack-assembly.md).

## Placement conventions

J90 uses Phoenix Contact **1803280 / C480530**, the horizontal 3.81 mm header.
Its exact numbered supplier pads are frozen in the placement registry. The
2026-09-28 live catalog showed 2,209 available to order, MOQ 1; stock is not reserved.
The matching 1803581 cable plug is separately sourced.

The exporter fits supplier numbered pads to native footprints using the frozen
[catalog geometry](../hw/assembly/groundlark-fpga-hat/daqhat-01-jlcpcb-placement.json). It accounts
for bottom-side projection and preserves absolute component positions.
Use its CPL rather than raw KiCad angles or manual per-reference offsets.

| References | Supplier CPL rotation |
| --- | --- |
| J1 (Bottom) | 0° |
| J4 | 270° |
| JP1, JP80, JP81 | 0° |
| J80, J81 | 180° |
| J82, J83 | 270° |
| J90 | 0° |
| U1, U22, U41, U42 | 270° |
| U100–U103 (Bottom) | 270° |
| Q1, U40, U51, U52 | 180° |
| D90 (Bottom, C915089) | 90° |
| C91, C92 (Top) | 0° |

Check J1's underside model and pin-1 direction in the supplier preview. Its
front-layer land pattern requires a bottom-mounted socket. Confirm mixed
SMT/THT assembly, reflow/cleaning limits and sensor handling with the supplier.
Each placement must have a part-bound catalog mapping
or explicit exception. Changed MPNs or footprints invalidate those mappings.
The full exporter and overlay use the same solver; repeated export does not
apply an extra rotation. This checks registration, not solder-joint reliability.

## Reproduce exports without changing CAD

Use KiCad 9.0.9 and a Python that imports `pcbnew` (WSL or the portable lab).
The exporter rejects source CAD/BOM hashes that differ from recorded validation,
checks all native DRC severities, validates the layer/drill inventory, and verifies
that BOM and CPL references agree. It refuses to overwrite a populated directory.

```bash
python3 hw/tools/jlcpcb_package.py --quantity 1 --output .local/jlcpcb/new-review
python3 -m unittest discover -s hw/tests -p 'test_jlcpcb*.py' -v
```

For optional independent plot inspection and PDF production, keep dependencies
inside the repo rather than installing into the atopile environment. The review
renderer uses rsvg-convert for luminance masks so silkscreen cutouts preserve
underlying copper, and draws the silkscreen above copper:

```bash

# Also requires rsvg-convert (librsvg2-bin on Debian/Ubuntu).
python3 -m venv --system-site-packages .local/fab-venv
.local/fab-venv/bin/pip install gerbonara==1.5.0 reportlab==4.4.10
.local/fab-venv/bin/python hw/tools/jlcpcb_inspect.py .local/jlcpcb/new-review
.local/fab-venv/bin/python hw/tools/jlcpcb_drawings.py .local/jlcpcb/new-review
```

The independent parser compares every exported hole location, diameter and
span to CAD (1 micrometre coordinate quantization), and parses all 13 plot layers.
The package report gives actual drill counts; no blind-drill files are accepted.
It emits benign parser warnings about KiCad's G90 header position and unused
RoundRect macro parameters; these are retained rather than suppressed. Render
the PDF with `pdftoppm` and inspect each page. Gerber parsing does not establish
DFM approval or validate solder-paste apertures against supplier process limits.

After adding the package README and reviewing the PDF, run
`python3 hw/tools/jlcpcb_seal.py .local/jlcpcb/new-review` to write checksums
and the complete review ZIP. This retains all manufacturing holds; it does not
promote the package to an approved release.
The assembly PDF reads J1 and J90 manufacturer, MPN and catalog identity from
that package's procurement CSV, keeping its instructions aligned with the BOM.
